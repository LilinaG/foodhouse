# Food House

An e-commerce page for a gourmet and healthy food restaurant. Clients and page administrators will be able to access different sections of the page. The dishes on the menu will be displayed and through a record you can access all the menu data to modify or add content.

This group project is an initiative proposed by the software and technology development training at FactorÃ­a F5.
